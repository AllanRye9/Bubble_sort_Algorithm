# Bubble_sort_Algorithm
The bubble sort Algorithm is one of the most interesting Algorithm i have ever coded which simply works by sorting an array in ascending order making elements that are heavier than the rest to fall to the buttom of the array giving the name bubble. In the array elements are compared one after the other pushing the bigger integers to the end.
